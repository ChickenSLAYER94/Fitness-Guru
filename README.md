# Fitness-Guru
This is a Kotlin based android application which is created especially for runners. As a person who just started running and putting emphasis on physical health, I really needing an app which can count my steps, show distanced traveled and calorie burned. The features which set this application different form its competitor is the integration of maps support and weather support. The main idea regarding this android application is people using this app donâ€™t have to switch multiple app while running or doing fitness activity. <br>
For example, before start running session user can check weather information to find if weather is good for running or not. And in the same app user can use maps to point to the destination where they want to go. The maps functionality will also give real-time location change in later version. For the main activity, pedometer is added where user can add or change the daily goal of steps. The main goal of this application is to transition form pedometer activity to weather activity, maps activity to pedometer activity seamlessly eliminating the need of switching multiple apps.
